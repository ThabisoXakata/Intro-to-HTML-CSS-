# WEEK 1
## Unit 1: Introduction to HTML & CSS
What is HTML?
- Hypertext Mark-up Language, also known as a declarative language, is used as a standard mark-up language designed to create web pages used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. It serves as a channel for different types of content like words, images, videos, audio, forms, and interactive experiences. It consists of a siries of elements that describe the structure of a web page and tells the browser how to display the content. HTML is a combination of hypertext, which defines the link between web pages, and the markup language that is used to define the text document within the tag that designs the structure of web pages.

What is CSS?
- Cascading style sheets acts as the stylist of web pages, meaning that it is responsible for how the we page looks in terms of the text fonts, colors, sizes, and has the capabilities of adding special animations and other ways of interactions in order to give the page visitor a satisfying web experience and interaction. CSS comes with computer system tricks and that makesit both fragile and powerful at the same time

## Unit 2: HTML Syntax
- HTML uses tags that are enclosed in less and greater than symbols "<>" to define elements that are like content containing packages. Many of these elements require both the opening and closing tags to function properly and provide the desired results.

To add on,  These tags are used to devide intended information(elements) in your program and let the computer know that these are seperate entities.
<!DOCTYPE html> The !DOCTYPE declaration is not a tag/element, but a declaration to the computer that the following document type is going to be HTML, XHTML, PHP, Javascript etc, so that it can be able to determine 
                which elements are going to be valid. This the first line required for every HTML code.
<title>Defines the title for the documents</title>
<p>Refers to the new paragraph's opening and closing tag.</p>

```
